### The best source of information for PNU

To install the program simply download by clicking the download button and extract the folder.

Run it and you are good to go; However this only works for Windows users currently, and your Word path has to be the standard!

### Usage

To use the program you have to select the very end of the page before the one, where you want the page numbers to start at. Click on the little icon in the top left besides the forward/backwards button. This enables you to insert page numbers on e.g. page three like you normally would. 

I hope you find it useful! If you have any questions shoot me an email at mjoerck@protonmail.com

Best regards
